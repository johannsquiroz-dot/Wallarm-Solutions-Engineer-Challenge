.# Wallarm Solutions Engineer Technical Evaluation

## üìå Overview

This technical challenge was a good exercise to get me familiar with the deployment of a Wallarm filtering node, connect to a backend and create syntetic traffick using the GoTestWaf attack simulation tools. The exercise showed traffic being monitored by the Wallarm solution, and subsequently the malicious traffic getting blocked. All of the tools and processes used are new to me (since my experience has been showcasing the value and benefits of solutions from the user interface perspective). This was a good learning experience personally.

## üéØ Objectives



‚úÖ Deploy a Wallarm filtering node using a supported method of your choice.  
‚úÖ Configure a backend origin to receive test traffic. (httpbin.org is also acceptable)  
‚úÖ Use the **GoTestWAF** attack simulation tool to generate traffic.  
‚úÖ Document the deployment and troubleshooting process.  
‚úÖ Demonstrate proficiency in using **Wallarm's official documentation**.

## üöÄ Task Breakdown

‚úÖ Deploy a Wallarm filtering node using a Docker


johanns@Discovery:~$ docker run -d -e WALLARM_API_TOKEN='rII9h4BWnfZpkagibXQdXHDF35iOVh4YEOqrxnlbfNuMoTaR9SxMwLD6rzvuJN2r' -e WALLARM_LABELS='group=<GROUP>' -e NGINX_BACKEND='httpbin.org' -e WALLARM_API_HOST='us1.api.wallarm.com' -e WALLARM_MODE='block' -p 8100:80 wallarm/node:6.3.0
8698d2ee610f5274f9f11f9e57fc2ee8b8fdcd71fd52c049dbedf2e84ebac27c



‚úÖ Configure a backend origin to receive test traffic. 


johanns@Discovery:~$ curl -v httpbin.org/get
*   Trying 3.229.116.23:80...
* Connected to httpbin.org (3.229.116.23) port 80 (#0)
> GET /get HTTP/1.1
> Host: httpbin.org
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*



‚úÖ Use the **GoTestWAF** attack simulation tool to generate traffic.

‚úÖ Document the deployment and troubleshooting process.  


* Conflicts on docker container and node ports used, had to select different ports to establish connectivity.
    * Filtering Node was deployed locally on Ubuntu with passthrough variables. I had to verify and change the commands since I was getting syntax errors.
    * Had to create a second filtering node to set the blocking directive. This was most likely due to my lack of experience setting up this platorm.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Notes

AT the end of this evaluation, I was able to:


‚úÖ Configure a backend origin to receive test traffic. (httpbin.org) 
‚úÖ Use the GoTestWAF attack simulation tool to generate traffic.
‚úÖ Document the deployment and troubleshooting process.
‚úÖ Navigated Wallarm's official documentation to complete the steps.


Notes & Observations
This project demonstrates how to run a local Wallarm filtering node on Ubuntu OS Docker and generate attack traffic using GoTestWAF against a backend origin (httpbin.org).
